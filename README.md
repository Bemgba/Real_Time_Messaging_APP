Users can start conversation with another user or create group and aid users to chat.
Group is only visible if you are a member of the group.every member can see the discription of the group and the list of user but the owner only has the permission to edit and delete

Group might contain multiple users, thousands of messages and even more shared files
deleting a group can be time expensive as the action will return to backgroud jobs where messages and attachments will have to be deleted too
when the group delete action is complete all users will be notified using web sockets and the group is gone.
its compactible on diferent screen sizes (even the smallest screen can view the APP)
